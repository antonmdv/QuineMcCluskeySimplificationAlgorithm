# Quine McCluskey Simplification Algorithm

<p> Using K-maps to find the minimized two-level form of a function is difficult for functions of more than 4 variables and nearly impossible for functions of more than 6 variables because it's hard to visualize and spot patterns in multidimensional space. <br> <br>
An alternative to using K-maps is the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. The Quine-McCluskey algorithm provides a systematic approach for finding the prime implicants and selecting a minimum cover. Because the algorithm is tedious it is better suited to machine implementation.</p>
